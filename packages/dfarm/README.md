This is a plugin/extension for the Farmbot to syncronize its web interface and monitoring activity with the Decentralized Internet SDK. This is done by basically syncing to the database host of the SDK, as well as calling its pipeline for various data access points. Currently, the configurations are being worked on.

Todo:
- Database host configs
- Connectivity Setup
- Data pipelines

# Please work on config.json + deployment.md
